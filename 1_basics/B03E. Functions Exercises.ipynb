    "1) Refer to the lesson notebooks and your notes in order to answer them but <b>don't</b> copy and paste over from them! You'll learn better if you start committing the code to muscle memory through typing!<br/>\n",
    "2) Go beyond the scope of the exercises wherever you can - feel free to try stuff and experiment. It's unlikely that you'll break anything.<br/>\n",
